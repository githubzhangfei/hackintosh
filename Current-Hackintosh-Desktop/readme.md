# Current Hackintosh Project 

This folder contains the current backup of my EFI folder, which was re-done October 16 because of a bug in upgrading from 0.7.3 to 0.7.4 rendering my old EFI unbootable.

## Warning
Do not use this EFI on your own system. You should always make your own EFI and config.plist file. This should only be used for reference.

## Status: GOLDEN
Given what I learned from my first attempt, I fortunately did not make the same mistakes as before. As such, everything works! Perfectly!
I'm using a MacPro7,1 SMBIOS.
