### TL;DR: Build your own config.plist.

# config.plist Warning!

Many people will post their config.plist files online in forums and nooks and crannys of the internet to be helpful, and some people with identical or close enough hardware configs may be able to use them without issue for some amount of time. However! you are saving yourself a potential future headache if you don't invest the time to do it right now. 

## As this relates to my config.plist

I have uploaded my config.plist to this repository, but I have made it very clear that you should not use my config.plist for very obvious reasons. Unless you have the **EXACT** same specifications as my computer, you really should make your own. Mine is here to serve as a backup, cause you really don't want to lose this, as well as a reference for others, as I have taken the time to go through and build this according to OpenCore spec (kinda).

## Protecting my privacy

Certain elements of my config.plist were removed to protect my privacy. Things like serial numbers and things specific to my computer were erased and would need to be replaced if used on a machine.

## Computer Specifications

If you do decide to be lazy and just use my config.plist **(highly unrecommended)** then at least make sure your computer has the same or similar (depends, you will still need to modify the config.plist) 

* CPU: Ryzen 3-1200
* RAM: 16GB DDR4-2666 (Crucial)
* Storage: 500GB WD SN550 NVMe SSD
* Graphics: VisionTek RX 480 8GB
* Motherboard: Gigglebyte B450M-DS3H

## A Note

Do not contact me or anybody else if you are having issues with this. Build your own instead. You can find how to do that on the [OpenCore Installation Guide (Desktop).](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/)
