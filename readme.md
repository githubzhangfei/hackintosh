# ctaetcsh's Hackintosh Repository
This repository contains backups of my EFI folder for both my historical hackintosh projects and current hackintosh projects. In addition, this repository serves as a place to document what works/what doesn't with each build as well as documentation for quirks I have encountered.

This repository is currently pending an update to include my current hackintosh project.
