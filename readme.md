# ctaetcsh's Hackintosh Repository
This repository contains backups of my EFI folder for both my historical hackintosh projects and current hackintosh projects. In addition, this repository serves as a place to document what works/what doesn't with each build as well as documentation for quirks I have encountered.

Update 2021-10-17: Repository has been updated with the most recent backup. Will be uploading copies of my notes soon.
